# Malware Analysis & Incident Response using Volatility

## Project Overview
This project involved a comprehensive forensic examination of memory dumps (`sample004.bin`, `WinDump.mem`, and `bimbo.mem`) from a potentially compromised system. The primary objective was to identify indicators of compromise, uncover hidden malware processes, analyze network activities, investigate mutexes for malicious intent, and recover sensitive information including email credentials through password cracking. This hands-on lab work was performed to enhance practical skills in cybersecurity incident response and digital forensics.

## Technologies & Tools Used
* **Operating System:** Kali Linux (with significant troubleshooting during setup/recovery)
* **Primary Forensics Tools:**
    * Volatility 2.6.1 & Volatility 3 (used for memory analysis)
    * John the Ripper (for password cracking)
    * YARA Rules (for malware pattern matching)
* **Network & Exploitation Tools (Contextual):**
    * Nmap (for network scanning - planned/used in broader context)
    * Wireshark (for network traffic analysis - planned/used in broader context)
    * Metasploit (for exploitation/payload generation - used in broader context, e.g., virus uploading)
* **Cryptography Tools:** (Implied, for encryption/decryption practice)

## Project Description & Methodology

### 1. Initial Access & Data Collection
* **Scenario:** Received memory dumps from a suspected infected system (`sample004.bin`, `WinDump.mem`, `bimbo.mem`). The challenge included recovering and accessing a password-protected email account related to the investigation.
* **Steps Taken:** Began by preparing the Kali Linux environment for forensic analysis. This involved initial setup and subsequent recovery/troubleshooting of the OS.

### 2. Memory Forensics & Malware Analysis
* **Objective:** Identify active and hidden processes, analyze network connections, and investigate mutexes to uncover malware indicators embedded within system processes.
* **Key Analysis Areas:**
    * **Process Analysis:** Identified active processes and investigated hidden processes, determining their parent processes and looking for anomalies.
    * **Network Activity:** Analyzed network connections present in memory for suspicious or unauthorized communications.
    * **Mutex Investigation:** Examined mutexes for known malware associations and unusual patterns.
* **Tools & Techniques:** Utilized various **Volatility 2 & 3 plugins** to perform in-depth memory analysis. While specific commands are extensive, the focus was on leveraging plugins to enumerate processes, inspect network sockets, and list mutexes.
    * *Example Volatility Commands (You would add specific ones here):*
        ```bash
        # e.g., To list active processes:
        # python vol.py -f sample004.bin windows.pslist.PsList

        # e.g., To identify hidden processes (via parent-child relationships or other anomalies):
        # python vol.py -f sample004.bin windows.pstree.PsTree

        # e.g., To analyze network connections:
        # python vol.py -f sample004.bin windows.netscan.NetScan

        # e.g., To search for mutexes (might require specific plugins or manual analysis):
        # python vol.py -f sample004.bin windows.handles --pid [PID] --type Mutex
        # python vol.py -f sample004.bin windows.mutantscan.MutantScan # Volatility 3
        ```
* **Password Cracking:** Employed John the Ripper to crack the password for the target email account, gaining access to critical information relevant to the incident.

### 3. Cryptography Practice (Integrated)
* **Objective:** Practiced secure file transfer by encrypting files using a public key and decrypting them with a private key, demonstrating understanding of asymmetric cryptography principles.

## Key Findings & Results
* Successfully identified **active and hidden malicious processes** that were cleverly embedded within legitimate system PIDs, requiring careful analysis to trace their true parent processes.
* Uncovered **suspicious network connections** indicating potential command-and-control communication or data exfiltration.
* Identified **malware indicators** through the investigation of mutexes.
* **Successfully cracked the email password**, providing access to crucial investigative leads.
* Demonstrated proficiency in **cryptography**, specifically public/private key encryption and decryption, to secure data.

## Challenges & Solutions
* **Volatility Version Inconsistencies:** Encountered issues with certain Volatility 2 and 3 commands not functioning as expected, requiring adaptation and debugging of commands or trying alternative plugins.
* **Operating System Recovery:** Faced a significant challenge with the Kali Linux OS becoming unresponsive, necessitating extensive troubleshooting and recovery efforts to restore the environment and continue the analysis. This experience significantly enhanced problem-solving and system administration skills.

## Lessons Learned
* **Power of Memory Forensics:** Memory forensics is an incredibly powerful technique for recovering extensive information, including admissible evidence suitable for legal proceedings.
* **Tool Synergy:** While individual tools like Volatility, John the Ripper, and YARA have unique strengths, their combined use (inter-twinning) provides a much more comprehensive and effective approach to incident response.
* **Incident Response Reporting:** Gained valuable experience in preparing incident response reports based on forensic findings, suitable for both technical management and court presentations.
* **Problem-Solving & Resilience:** The challenges encountered, particularly with OS recovery, reinforced the importance of troubleshooting skills and resilience in a real-world cybersecurity environment.

**Next Steps for You:**

* **Review and Refine:** Read through the draft. Does it accurately capture your work?
* **Add Specific Commands/Outputs:** This is the most crucial part! If you have notes or recall specific Volatility commands you ran for `pslist`, `netscan`, `mutantscan`, `pstree`, or any other key commands with John the Ripper, please add them under "Project Description & Methodology". Even small snippets of actual command-line output would be very impactful.
* **Screenshots (Future):** When you put this on GitHub, consider including screenshots of your Volatility output, Wireshark captures, or Kali Linux sessions (ensuring no sensitive data is visible).

What do you think of this draft? Let me know if you want to make any adjustments or if you have specific commands you'd like to include!
