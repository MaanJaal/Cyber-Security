# 🧪 Cybersecurity Virtual Lab Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a cybersecurity lab environment for practicing ethical hacking, forensic analysis, and network security. It includes the setup of virtual machines, execution of penetration tests, and documentation of findings.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Set up a secure virtual lab using Kali Linux and target machines.
- Perform encryption/decryption, memory dump analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
- Simulate attacks using Metasploit and John the Ripper.
- Analyze network traffic using Wireshark and Nmap.
- Document all procedures and findings for portfolio use.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Virtualization**: VirtualBox / VMware
- **Operating Systems**: Kali Linux, Windows 10
- **Security Tools**: Metasploit, John the Ripper, Nmap, Wireshark
- **Forensics**: Volatility, FTK Imager
- **Languages**: Bash, Python (optional)

## 🧱 Lab Setup
- Kali Linux installed and configured
- Target machine (Windows 10) with vulnerable services
- Host-only network configuration
- USB-based attack simulation

## 🔍 Activities Completed
- ✅ File encryption and decryption
- ✅ Memory dump forensic scanning
- ✅ USB-based virus deployment and access gain
- 🔜 Wireshark and Nmap scanning (scheduled for tomorrow)

## 📊 Results & Findings
- [Insert screenshots or logs]
- [Summarize key vulnerabilities discovered]
- [Explain how access was gained and mitigated]

## 📁 Documentation
- [Link to lab manual or PDF]
- [Link to attack simulation report]
- [Link to video demo (optional)]

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Complete Wireshark and Nmap scans
- Add Power BI dashboard for traffic analysis
- Begin drafting incident response plan
